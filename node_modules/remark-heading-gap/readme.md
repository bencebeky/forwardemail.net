[**remark**][remark] plugin to adjust the gap between headings.


## Install

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install remark-heading-gap
```


## Use

Say we have a Markdown file, `example.md`, that looks as follows:

```markdown
# remark-heading-gap

## Example

## API

### `remark.use(headingGap[, options])`

## Contributing
```

And our script, `example.js`, contains:

```js
const fs = require('fs')
const remark = require('remark')
const gap = require('remark-heading-gap')

const result = remark()
  .use(gap)
  .processSync(fs.readFileSync('example.md'))
  .toString()

console.log(result)
```

Now, running `node example` yields:

```markdown
# remark-heading-gap


## Example


## API

### `remark.use(headingGap[, options])`


## Contributing
```


## API

### `remark().use(headingGap[, options])`

Adjust the gap between headings.
Ensures that automatically generated Markdown follows your own rules for blank
lines between section headings.
From personal experience, adding extra newlines helps to visualize breaks in
sections, especially when quickly scanning documentation.

#### `options.{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}`

Pass a gap (Object, default: `{before: '\n', after: ''}` for `options.2`,
`{before: '', after: ''}` for all others)
Customize the gap that appears for up to 6 levels of heading; for example, pass
`{1: {before: '\n', after: '\n'}}` to double the gap for the first heading.
Note that both `before` and `after` accept a custom string so you can specify
`\r\n` instead if you choose; or add other presentational markers.


## Security

Use of `remark-heading-gap` does not involve [**rehype**][rehype]
([**hast**][hast]) or user content so there are no openings for
[cross-site scripting (XSS)][xss] attacks.
